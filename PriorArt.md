Patentability: NONE

I have to type a few paragraphs about why patent trolls can't sue over this, and why it is possible that they will, anyways.  I'm wasting this time because you can't create anything in the 21st century without potentially being sued over it.

Renaming client/server technology that has existed since the 1960s, and calling it a 'cloud' with new jargon to obfuscate its origins does not mean it is new technology.  If you want to trademark or copyright your new jargon, that's _different_ from a patent.  Unfortunately, the USPTO is staffed by apes.

First and foremost, one must bear in mind that TCP/IP is a serial connection technology, just as the original terminals used serial cables and MODEMs, we communicate now with serial cables with a smaller plug, and/or wirelessly (but still serially), today.  The MODEMs are still there, they just don't make a lot of noise, like they used to.

I may as well patent putting wheat bread into a toaster, because all of the 'how to' pictures show putting white bread in.

I may as well patent stacking lego blocks of certain shapes and colors on top of each other.

There are MANY kinds of prior art for this.  KVM (keyboard, video, mouse over IP, more recently renamed to 'Remote Desktop', with a slew of patents on the same old thing) terminals for mainframe computers, etc.

Using the classical nomenclature, this server is for a 'raster mode graphical dumb terminal, over a serial connection'.  Of course, mix the wording around with new jargon and add 'cloud' to it, and the USPTO idiots are only too happy to grant a patent troll something to legally extort money from anyone who wants to CREATE anything.

Here is how this works.

The server runs some software, and makes pictures, and noises.
The web clients shows these pictures to the users, one after another, as it gets them.

The users do things with their mouse and keyboard, or touch, and the server receives that, and does stuff which generally affects the future pictures and noises.

Just like a web browser, and multiplayer games going way back work.  Just dumber than usual.  In fact, the client is a web page, running in a web browser.

We're just sending pictures over IP, the same as every other streaming CODEC and KVM and terminal that has existed for far longer than 20 years, some for half a century or more.

So now to some 'prior art'.  I can spend a week and come up with a hundred examples of doing this, that are all more than 20 years old:

In other words, NO this is not novel.  Like a 'LAN Party', it is VERY old, and I'm just dusting it off and making any HTML5 browser into a  dumb raster terminal for the same game, using a bit of script in the browser.
