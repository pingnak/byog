This implements a web server on top of a render/gaming engine (in this case Flash/AIR).  Includes one running demonstration/torture test app.  Allows multiple players to bring their own devices to play, or use their own mobile devices as interactive controllers for a game.  Most relatively recent browsers should work.  No install.  No plugin.  Just play.

Well, OK, someone needs to install the Adobe AIR runtime and the server its self, and run it.  From then on, anyone with any device with a (recent enough) web browser should be able to connect to it, and play.

Naturally, there are limitations and security concerns, with running this, naked on the internet.
